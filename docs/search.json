Furthermore, we require all participants to have identifiable accounts in Bioconductor online forums. Accounts that do not adhere to this after request to de-anonymise may be deleted.\nWe do not tolerate harassment, intimidation, or bullying of community members. Sexual language and imagery are not appropriate in presentations, communications or in online venues, including chats.\nAny person/s violating the Code of Conduct may be sanctioned or expelled temporarily or permanently from an electronic platform or event at the discretion of the Code of Conduct committee.\nThe Bioconductor community is committed to ethical partnerships and avoiding partnerships with entities whose practices are inconsistent with Bioconductor values. We encourage community members to report or raise concerns about partnerships they deem unethical to the Code of Conduct committee via the reporting form.\n\n\nHarassment includes, but is not limited to:\n\nMaking comments in chats, to an audience or personally, that belittle or demean another person\nSharing sexual images online\nHarassing photography or recording\nSustained disruption of talks or other events\nUnwelcome sexual attention\nAdvocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior\n\nIntimidation and bullying include, but are not limited to:\n\nAggressive or browbeating behavior\nMocking or insulting another person‚Äôs intellect, work, perspective, or question/comment\nMaking reference to someone‚Äôs gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion, or other personal attributes in the context of a scientific discussion\nDeliberately making someone feel unwelcome\nTrolling behaviour (deliberately inflammatory or offensive messages)\nSustained off-topic posts\n\n\n\n\n\nAnyone asked to stop harassing or intimidating behavior are expected to comply immediately.\nIf a person contravene the Code of Conduct, the Code of Conduct committee retains the right to take any action that ensures a welcoming environment for all community members. This includes warning the alleged offender or temporary/permanent expulsion from the event and/or electronic platforms under Bioconductor‚Äôs control.\nThe Code of Conduct committee may take action to redress anything designed to, or with the clear impact of, disrupting an event or electronic communication platform or making the environment hostile for any community member.\nWe expect everyone in the Bioconductor community to comply with the Code of Conduct when participating in Bioconductor events and online communication platforms.\n\n\n\nIf someone makes you or anyone else feel unsafe or unwelcome, please report it as soon as possible. You can make a report either anonymously or personally. All reports will be reviewed by the Code of Conduct Committee and will be kept confidential.\n\n\nYou can make an anonymous or non-anonymous report via the following link: https://forms.gle/gEWHBWnXvZbEdFsq5. It is a free-form text box that will be forwarded to the Code of Conduct Committee. Alternatively you can email the Code of Conduct Committee (code-of-conduct@bioconductor.org). If you are uncomfortable reporting to the Code of Conduct committee as a group, you can contact any individual committee member via email or a direct message on the community-bioc Slack channel. Please include screenshots/copies of all relevant electronic conversations whenever possible (you don‚Äôt need to compromise your anonymity!).\nWe can‚Äôt follow up an anonymous report with you directly, but we will fully investigate it and take whatever action is necessary to prevent a recurrence.\n\n\n\nYou can make a personal report to any member of the event Code of Conduct committee present at an event.\nWhen taking a personal report, we will ensure you are safe and cannot be overheard. We may involve other event staff to ensure your report is managed properly. Once safe, we‚Äôll ask you to tell us about what happened. This can be upsetting, but we‚Äôll handle it as respectfully as possible, and you can bring someone to support you. You won‚Äôt be asked to confront anyone, and we won‚Äôt tell anyone who you are.\nOur team will be happy to help you get the relevant support (e.g.¬†help contacting hotel/venue security, local law enforcement, local support services, provide escorts, or otherwise assist you to feel safe for the duration of the event).\nWe value your attendance and participation at Bioconductor events and in our community.\n\n\n\nWe understand that you may want a person unrelated to Bioconductor overseeing your conflict resolution. To facilitate this, the Code of Conduct Committee will appoint an ombudsperson from a different open source community than members of the Bioconductor project. While they do not have power to establish, change or set aside decisions made by the Code of Conduct Committee, they can assist community members by offering consultation, mediation, coaching and referrals to other resources. The ombudsperson can be contacted directly via email (see below) to ensure a confidential, impartial, informal and independent process.\n\n\n\nThe Code of Conduct Committee follows a standard procedure to deal with conflicts.

You won‚Äôt be asked to confront anyone, and we won‚Äôt tell anyone who you are.\nOur team will be happy to help you get the relevant support (e.g.¬†help contacting hotel/venue security, local law enforcement, local support services, provide escorts, or otherwise assist you to feel safe for the duration of the event).\nWe value your attendance and participation at Bioconductor events and in our community.\n\n\n\nWe understand that you may want a person unrelated to Bioconductor overseeing your conflict resolution. To facilitate this, the Code of Conduct Committee will appoint an ombudsperson from a different open source community than members of the Bioconductor project. While they do not have power to establish, change or set aside decisions made by the Code of Conduct Committee, they can assist community members by offering consultation, mediation, coaching and referrals to other resources. The ombudsperson can be contacted directly via email (see below) to ensure a confidential, impartial, informal and independent process.\n\n\n\nThe Code of Conduct Committee follows a standard procedure to deal with conflicts. This procedure is briefly summarized here. Incident procedures are based on the book ‚ÄúHow to Respond to Code of Conduct Reports‚Äù by Valerie Aurora and Mary Gardiner.\n\n\n\n\n(Co-Chair) Anna Quaglieri anna.quaglieri16@gmail.com (until 2024) she/her [EN, IT]\n(Co-Chair) Gerry Tonkin-Hill g.tonkinhill@gmail.com (until 2025) he/him [EN]\nMart√≠n D√°vila-Cervantes aldntmi@gmail.com (until 2025) he/him [EN, FR, ES]\nFederica Gazzelloni fede.gazzelloni@gmail.com (until 2025) she/her [IT, EN]\nMichael Love michaelisaiahlove@gmail.com (until 2024) he/him [EN] (TAB)\nFederico Marini fede.maro@gmail.com (until 2024) he/him [EN, IT, DE]\nSowmya Parthiban sowmyaparthiban@gmail.com (until 2024) she/her [EN, Tamil]\nShixiang Wang wangshx@shanghaitech.edu.cn (until 2025) he/him [CN, EN]\nLlu√≠s Revilla lluis.revilla@gmail.com (until 2024) he/him [CAT, ES, EN]\nKevin Rue-Albrecht kevinrue67@gmail.com (until 2024) he/him [FR, EN] (CAB)\nPaulina Boadiwaa Mensah pabbyboadiwaa@gmail.com (until 2025) she/her [EN, Akan]\nPeace Sandy peacesandy04@gmail.com she/her (until 2025) [EN]\nSinmisoluwa Adesanya adesanyasinmisoluwa@gmail.com she/her (until 2025) [EN, Yoruba]\n(Ombudsperson) Michelle Savage michellesavage.galaxy@gmail.com (Galaxy project) she/her [ES, EN]"
