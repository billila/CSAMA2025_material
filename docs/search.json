See the Resources page for more info.\n\n\nOverview\nThe one-week intensive summer school Biological Data Science teaches advanced computational analyses of modern molecular data types in biology and biomedicine, including single cell and spatial omics. It comprises lectures covering underlying theory and concepts, practical hands-on exercises, and informal discussion sessions. Lecture topics include modern biotechnologies for quantitative measurements, statistical analysis, visualisation, and computational tools. Hands-on exercises are looking at state-of-the-art datasets, using the R / Bioconductor environment. At the end of the course, you should be better able to design, implement and interpret analyses on your own (multi-)omic, single and/or spatial data, adapt and combine different tools, and make informed and scientifically sound choices about analysis strategies.\n\n\nFaculty and Teaching Assistants\n\n\n\nAnne-Laure Boulesteix, Ludwig Maximilians Universitat Munchen\n\nMaria Doyle, University of Limerick\n\nRobert Gentleman, Harvard Medical School\n\nPhilippine Louail, Eurac Research\n\nDavide Risso, University of Padova\n\nIlaria Billato, University of Padova\n\n\n\n\nVince Carey, Harvard Medical School\n\nLaurent Gatto, UCLouvain\n\nWolfgang Huber, European Molecular Biology Laboratory\n\nMichael Love, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill\n\nCharlotte Soneson, Friedrich Miescher Institute for Biomedical Research\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOrganised in collaboration with"
