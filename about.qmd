# About the Summer School
::: {.justify}
The summer school is intended for researchers who have basic familiarity with the experimental technologies and their applications in biology, and who are interested in making the step from a user of bioinformatics software towards **adapting or developing their own analysis workflows**.

The four practical sessions of the summer school will require you to **follow and modify scripts in the computer language R**.

# Topics Covered

The programme covers a wide range of topics, including but not limited to:

-   **Introduction to R and Bioconductor**
-   **Elements of statistics**: visualization, regression, PCA and other low-dimensional embeddings, statistical tests incl. multiple, classification / supervised machine learning
-   **RNA-Seq data analysis** – both bulk and single-cell
-   **Spatial omics and annotation workflows** – genes, genomic features, variants, transcripts, and proteins
-   **Mass spectrometry-based proteomics and metabolomics**
-   **Immunobioinformatics**
-   **Experimental design**, batch effects, and confounding
-   **Reproducible research** and workflow authoring with R Markdown
-   **Package development**, version control, and developer tools
